# ORMM
A "World of Warcraft" AddOn that allows a player to collect and analyze data on (old, soloable) dungeons and raids. The goal is to, on a player-by-player level, help the player see what dungeons/raids are most effecting for making the most money possible in the least amount of time, and how factors like level, class, difficulty, etc. factor into this.
